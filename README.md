# SwiftOrganizer
This is a simple organizer for iPhone. 
Was implemented in Swift.
I have made this application for trying out the new language.  
Here was used the next things:
- Core Data
- Storyboard
- Autolayout

On the first start are being created some tasks. 
You can add a new task by pressing on button '+' on the navigator bar. 
You can edit task by selecting row on the table view. 
You can also delete any task by left swipe gesture on the table view row. 
You can make fetch tasks. For that are used two tab bar view. Upper tab bar is used 
for filtering by category. Category - is the entity which you can use for logical 
separating tasks. There are predefined category: 'ToDo', 'Work', 'Life', 'Events'.
I plan to give an opportunity for adding or removing their. Bottom tab bar is used 
for filtering tasks by more detailed things which I called 'Icons'.

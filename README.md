# SwiftOrganizer
This is a simple organizer. It is implemented in Swift.
I made this application to try the new language for me.  
It works on iPhone. In this application was used next things:
- Core Data
- Storyboard
- Autolayout
On the first start are created some tasks. 
You can add new task by press on button '+' on the navigator bar. 
You can edit task by selecting row on the table view. 
You can also delete any task by swiping on the left gesture. 
You can make fetch tasks. For that are used two tab bar view. Upper tab bar is used 
for filtering by category. Category - is the entity which you can use for logical 
separating tasks. There are predefined category: 'ToDo', 'Work', 'Life', 'Events'.
I plan to give an opportunity for adding or removing their. Bottom tab bar is used 
for filtering tasks by more detailed things which I called 'Icons'.
